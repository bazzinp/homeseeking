Daily E-Mail update from home advertisements at Homegate
Very broad filters are applied at Homegate user account and several EMails are 
sent every day to the specified EMail address.
What the script does is to read every day the EMails from the Email Inbox
and send on a daily basis an update with all the useful information 
for each of the houses/appartments like address, space, pictures of the house,
distance to work etc., all in a form of a table, where the columns are the variables of
interest and rows are the houses (observations)
The script is written in R
